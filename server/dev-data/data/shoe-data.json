The adidas Yeezy 500 is one of the more popular designs under the Yeezy umbrella thanks to its vintage roots and use of elevated materials. A now-signature layered upper features white mesh on the mid panel, tongue and heel. Premium light grey suede overlays add a subtle-but-welcoming contrasting touch. The white midsole omits familiar Boost found in other Yeezy models and instead employs supple adi-PRENE cushioning for all-day wearability. Completing the look of this sought-after model is a light cream chunky Feet You Wear outsole famously seen on early adidas Kobe Bryant models. Release date: August 24th, 2019.",

Like all other 2019 releases of the model, it also features translucent monofilament side stripes.
