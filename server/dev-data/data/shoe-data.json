        "description": "The adidas Yeezy 500 Bone White is a refreshingly minimal take on the early-aughts basketball-inspired sneaker from adidas and Kanye West. The adidas Yeezy 500 is one of the more popular designs under the Yeezy umbrella thanks to its vintage roots and use of elevated materials. A now-signature layered upper features white mesh on the mid panel, tongue and heel. Premium light grey suede overlays add a subtle-but-welcoming contrasting touch. The white midsole omits familiar Boost found in other Yeezy models and instead employs supple adi-PRENE cushioning for all-day wearability. Completing the look of this sought-after model is a light cream chunky Feet You Wear outsole famously seen on early adidas Kobe Bryant models. Release date: August 24th, 2019.",

This version of the Yeezy Boost 350 V2 features a similar look to the “Static” release of early 2019, but with a creamy white shade mixed with the grey tones across the intricately patterned Primeknit upper and translucent rubber sole unit. This release is a more limited version of the “Lundmark” colorway with reflective accents intertwined into the woven upper. Like all other 2019 releases of the model, it also features translucent monofilament side stripes. One variation from most releases of the 350 V2 for this “Lundmark” colorway is the absence of the large heel tab loops in favor of a slightly more simplified look. The adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 “Lundmark Reflective” released during the summer of 2019 and is now another coveted colorway of the sneaker",
